# Supermarket Frontend

This project was developed for a university class. The task was to create an app featuring a shopping cart, user account creation, and home page. The project is integrated with the backend, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and enabling supermarket staff to add, edit, or delete products.


## Key Learnings
The primary challenge revolved around integrating the shopping cart feature due to numerous bugs. Connecting it with the backend and JWT posed considerable difficulty. However, this project provided a deeper understanding of these aspects.
